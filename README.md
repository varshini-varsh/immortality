# HackerEarth Hackathon

# Motivation
My mother is a surgeon, thus in times of medical emergency, she is forced to rely on nurses and medical textbooks rather than pharmacists to receive the prescriptions she needs for her patients. 

# Problem Statement
* Non-pharmacists are 13 times more likely to make a pharmaceutical error, which is a problem.
* In fact, over 1 million medical injuries and over one fatality occur each year as a result of pharmaceutical errors, according to the FDA.

# Findings
* After interacting with various medical experts, discovered that,
* The majority of errors are caused by a lack of knowledge regarding drug names, pill shapes, dosages, and medication locations at pharmacies.

# Solution
* A typical medical text can fill 150 prescriptions each day.
* With "Immortality“, we are enabling non-pharmacists to rapidly and accurately fill prescriptions by utilising mixed reality technology.
* Mixed reality creates a distinctive experience by combining components of both AR and VR.
* Based on the prescription and Pharmacy layout, indicators and pathways are generated dynamically.
* This enables hospitals to save lives by providing staff with the skills and knowledge of accomplished pharmacists, ultimately saving thousands of lives.

# Methodology
* Incoming prescription pill request from the patient.
* Tap to accept
* It will reroute to the necessary tablet and specify the proper dosage.
* The next step is for the user to tap and then let go of their finger.
* Therefore, it permits non-pharmacists to take the proper dosage.
* The process then repeats itself with the subsequent tablet and appropriate dosage until the desired medications has been consumed.
* The message “Prescription fill complete" is returned once all of the medications have been consumed.
